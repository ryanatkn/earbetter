## intro

In 2016 I made a simple ear training game named
[Ear Sharpener](https://github.com/ryanatkn/ear-sharpener) that was interesting to me,
but it wasn't a very good training tool or much fun to use after the novelty wore off.
This is a followup with a new design that's trying to be more useful and fun.
It also has some experiences besides the ear trainer itself
(like [/piano](https://earbetter.ryanatkn.com/piano)),
and soon it'll publish Svelte components and JS/TS helpers
for music and audio programming (like `Piano.svelte`).
It's online at [earbetter.ryanatkn.com](https://earbetter.ryanatkn.com/).

earbetter is designed for MIDI devices like piano keyboards, but it also works without them.
